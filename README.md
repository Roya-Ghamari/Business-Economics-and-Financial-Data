This project analyzes unemployment rates in three European countries (Germany, Italy, and Greece) using time series models. The dataset includes monthly unemployment rates by sex and age, along with complementary economic indicators such as GDP, Consumer Price Index, and Balance of Payments.

Methodology:

Germany: Linear Regression, Holt-Winters, ARIMA, Generalized Additive Models (GAM)

Italy: Linear Regression, Holt-Winters, ARIMA, Generalized Bass Model, GAM

Greece: Linear Regression, Smoothing Splines, Diffusion Models, Holt-Winters, Gradient Boosting


Key Findings:

Holt-Winters performed best for Germany and Greece, while SARIMA was the best model for Italy.

Greece showed the most variations in unemployment post-2008.

Economic indicators (GDP, CPI, Balance of Payments) were significant predictors for Greece.
